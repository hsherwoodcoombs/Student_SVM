This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy

scikit-learn (You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook)


Template code is provided in the notebook student_intervention.ipynb notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory student_intervention/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
